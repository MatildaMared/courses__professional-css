							What do I need to start mushroom foraging?
						</h3>
						<p>
							You'll need a local field guide, a sharp knife or scissors, a
							basket or mesh bag for collecting, and paper bags for separating
							specimens. Bring a small brush for cleaning, wear sturdy boots,
							and carry a GPS device or compass to track your location. A camera
							is also helpful to document your finds.

						<img src="/assets/identify-mushrooms.webp" alt="A mushroom with a white stem and red cap on top of a mushroom identifying book" />
						<h3 class="card__title">How can I identify edible mushrooms?</h3>
						<p>
							Learn from experienced foragers and reliable guidebooks – never
							rely on apps alone. Study each mushroom's specific features like
							cap shape, gill structure, stem characteristics, and spore prints.
							Start with easily identifiable species that have no poisonous
							lookalikes, and never eat anything unless you're completely
							certain of its identification.

						<img src="/assets/where-to-find.webp" alt="A mushroom with a white stem and red cap covered in brown leaves" />
						<h3 class="card__title">Where can I find foraging spots?</h3>
						<p>
							Look in deciduous forests, especially near oak and maple trees,
							and in damp, shaded areas. Fallen logs and dead trees are often
							productive spots. Only forage on public lands where it's allowed,
							and always check local regulations. Remember to get permission for
							private property and keep your best locations private to prevent
							over-harvesting.

						<h3 class="card__title">
							What are the best seasons for mushroom foraging?
						</h3>
						<p>
							Spring is ideal for morels, late summer brings chanterelles and
							boletes, and fall is peak season for most mushrooms including
							oysters and hen of the woods. Some species can even be found in
							winter, especially in milder climates. Each season offers
							different varieties, so year-round foraging is possible.
